# A Replication Study on Code Comprehension and Expertise using Lightweight Biometric Sensors: Replication Package ICPC 2019

The replication package contains:

- **trayapp**: an application that shows a button in the right bottom of the screen. When the button is pressed, the current timestamp is saved in  `"C:\Users\<user>\times.csv"`.

  To run tryapp, double click on `trayapp.exe`

- **psycode:** an application that randomly shows the code and prose comprehension tasks. The answer is given pressing the left or right keyboard arrow. When the arrow is pressed, the following information are saved in `"C:\Users\<user>\answer_timestamp.csv"`:

  - name of task
  - number of the answer
  - id of the subject
  - UNIX timestamp of the answer
  - value of the answer (Accept or Reject)

  To run psycode, double click on `psycode.exe`

- BiometricAnalysis: contains the scripts, datasets and results used in the study
